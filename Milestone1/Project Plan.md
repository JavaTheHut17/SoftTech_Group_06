## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The objective of this project (Nutra Graph) is to develop a food and nutrition software that showcases the visualisation of data in relation to a global food nutritional database containing various food from around the world. The project will use python to build a GUI that will display this data in a graphical format. The information contained in this database can be utilised for a wide variety of health and medical research applications.

## 1.3 Project Scope

### 1.3.1 Scope Statement

Nutra Graph will be designed to utilise nutritional databases and provide a graphical breakdown of the data allowing healthcare professionals, and others to easily distinguish patterns and common occurrences in the data relevant to their field.

### 1.3.2 Project Deliverables

1. Functions:

    - Search Food items: The project will provide a search bar that will enable users to search for specific types of food in the database.
    - Nutrition Breakdown: The user selects a food item in the database for the software to break down and display in relative means, eg Pie Graph & Bar Graphs.
    - Nutrition Range Filter: Allows the user to select a nutritional component and input a min-max value and have relative foods listed that fall into that category.
    - Nutrition Level Filter: Allows users to filter food based on levels, High ( > 66% ), Medium ( 33% - 66% ) ,Low ( < 33% ) based on Fat, Protein, Carbohydrates, Sugar, and Nutritional Density.
    - Nutrition Component Organiser: Allows user to filter food on the database based on the Highest or Lowest nutritional component eg.. Foods with the highest Magnesium per 100g.


2. Documents/Reports:

    - Project Plan Document
    - Software Design Document
    - Work Breakdown Structure
    - Gant Chart 
    - Use Case Diagram 
    - Software Design Flow Chart

    - Visual Design Wireframe
   

3. Software

    - Nutra Graph Software

### 1.3.3 Project Acceptance Criteria

1. Functionality

    As defined in the Project Deliverables.

    - Nutra Graph must allow users to search for food items in the database and retrieve said items.
    - The software will allow users to select a food and have data displayed in a Pie & Bar Graph format.
    - The software will allow users to select a nutritional component and input a min/max value to list food that falls into the selected range.
    - The software will allow users to filter foods by nutritional content level Low, Medium and High.
    - The software will allow users to filter food in the database based on the Highest or Lowest nutritional component levels, eg.. highest /lowest fat content. 

2. Performance 

    - Software is quick and responsive with sub 2 second search times.
    - Software can handle a large database > 2300 food Items.
    - Software can be used on all major OS, Windows, Mac OS, Linux.

3. User Interface 

    - Software Must be user Friendly, easy to use and navigate.
    - User Friendly design, High contrast colours and clear text.
    - Data must be displayed clearly and in a usable fashion. 

4. Security 

    - User data must be handled correctly and securely, meeting industry standards on encryption.

### 1.3.4 Project Exclusions 

1. Ongoing Maintenance 

    - This software is stand alone and will not undertake any ongoing maintenance or updates from our team once the final product is handed over.

2. Updates To Database 

    - No additional updates to the database will continue once the project is handed over.

3. Mobile Application.

    - This is a standalone software no mobile application will be delivered.


## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.

![WBS](./WBS.jpg)

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.

| Activity #No | Activity Name | Brief Description | Duration | Responsible Team Members |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| xxx          | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx \& yyy               |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | All                      |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx                      |

## 4. Gantt Chart
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
